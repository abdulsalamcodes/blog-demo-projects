# gRPC Practice

This repository contains a practical example of implementing a User Management System using gRPC, Node.js, Express, Handlebars, and other libraries. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how gRPC can be utilized for building a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality within a Node.js environment.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have Node.js installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can download and install it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

After installing Node.js, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/grpc-practice.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd grpc-practice
   ```

3. Install project dependencies by running:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

This project consists of both a server and a client component. Here's how to run each of them:

### Server

To start the server, use the following command:

```
npm start
```

The server will be running at `http://localhost:30043`.

### Client

To run the client application, open a new terminal window and execute the following command:

```
npm run startClient
```

The client will interact with the server, allowing you to perform CRUD operations on the User Management System.
